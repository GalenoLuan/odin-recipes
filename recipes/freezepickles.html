    <p>This recipe for refrigerator pickles with celery seed was given to me by my late mother-in-law and makes use of the abundant summertime supply of cucumbers. A neighbor recently presented me with four (5-gallon) buckets of cucumbers from his garden, and I made pickles for the whole neighborhood. The pickles will stay fresh in the refrigerator for 2 1/2 to 3 weeks.</p>

        <li>1 cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
